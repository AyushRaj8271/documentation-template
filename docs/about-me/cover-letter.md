# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Team,

I recently came across the Hyperledger Mentorship Program during my exploration of opportunities in Blockchain-related technologies on LinkedIn. The program's mission immediately caught my attention, and I became interested in contributing significantly to the project's objectives.

Upon diving into the projects, I noticed that some were excelling in terms of well-maintained documentation and user accessibility, while others, particularly new projects, were facing accessibility issues due to a lack of proper documentation. This realization led me to believe that enhancing Calipher's documentation techniques could greatly benefit newcomers in the Hyperledger community

With a technical background and a keen interest in blockchain, I am eager to delve into enterprise-scale blockchain technologies like Calipher. As a senior pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering, I have authored numerous technical blogs during my time as a Technical Content Writing Intern. These experiences have honed my technical skills and deepened my understanding of complex technical subjects.

My internships as a Techincal Content Writer and Software Development Engineer for 6 and 11 months, respectively, have further demonstrated my competency in technical skills, teamwork, and collaboration.

My "never give up" attitude drives my passion for learning and exploring new technologies and domains, pushing me to confront challenges head-on.

I believe that starting with user documentation could be the cornerstone of my community contribution to Hyperledger. My experience with documentation challenges has equipped me well to address common pain points. I am enthusiastic about discussing how my skills and experiences can assist Hyperledger in improving Calipher's documentation.

Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to discuss further with you.

Sincerely,

Ayush Raj
