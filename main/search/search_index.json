The program's mission immediately caught my attention, and I became interested in contributing significantly to the project's objectives.</p> <p>Upon diving into the projects, I noticed that some were excelling in terms of well-maintained documentation and user accessibility, while others, particularly new projects, were facing accessibility issues due to a lack of proper documentation. This realization led me to believe that enhancing Calipher's documentation techniques could greatly benefit newcomers in the Hyperledger community</p> <p>With a technical background and a keen interest in blockchain, I am eager to delve into enterprise-scale blockchain technologies like Calipher. As a senior pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering, I have authored numerous technical blogs during my time as a Technical Content Writing Intern. These experiences have honed my technical skills and deepened my understanding of complex technical subjects.</p> <p>My internships as a Techincal Content Writer and Software Development Engineer for 6 and 11 months, respectively, have further demonstrated my competency in technical skills, teamwork, and collaboration.</p> <p>My \"never give up\" attitude drives my passion for learning and exploring new technologies and domains, pushing me to confront challenges head-on.</p> <p>I believe that starting with user documentation could be the cornerstone of my community contribution to Hyperledger. My experience with documentation challenges has equipped me well to address common pain points. I am enthusiastic about discussing how my skills and experiences can assist Hyperledger in improving Calipher's documentation.</p> <p>Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to discuss further with you.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Ayush Raj</p>"},{"location":"about-me/resume/","title":"Resume","text":""},{"location":"about-me/resume/#about-myself","title":"About myself","text":"<p>An engineer, who's just doing the basics of being one by solving problems, asking questions, finding answers, seeking opportunities and learning things as life happens.
